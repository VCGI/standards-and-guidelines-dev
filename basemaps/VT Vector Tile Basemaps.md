## Services

- [National Map Services](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/services/)
- [USGS Topo](https://basemap.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/USGSTopo/MapServer)  - combines the most current data (boundaries, geographic names, transportation, elevation, hydrography, land cover, and other themes) that make up The National Map. Contours generated for the US Topo product are included and are visible along with other data to 1:9,000 zoom scale. **EPSG:102100 (3857)**

For USGS basemap services, tiled base maps [are cached from global scale to a scale of 1:9,000](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-difference-between-tiled-and-dynamic-services) (and presumably render on demand below 1:9,000)

## Symbols

- [USGS Topographic Map Symbol Sheet](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/where-can-i-find-topographic-map-symbol-sheet) [(Sample)](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/us-topo-map-symbol-file-sample)

## Projections

- Tiled Base Map Service: World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere)
- Dynamic Base Map Services: WGS 84 / [EPSG:4326](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/)
- Contours: Not projected, but provided in geographic coordinates (lat / lon) in units of decimal degrees, horizontally referenced to NAD 1983 datum. Elevation values referenced to NAVD 88 datum.
